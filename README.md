# About_Me
A little bit about myself.
My name is Farid Wakim.
I am currently learning (B.S) Computer Science at the Lebanese International University.
I was born on the 16th of October, 1999.
I loved programming and tinkering as a whole ever since I was little.
I sometimes tinker on one of my 3 ARDUINO'S (or RASPBERRY PI) which I love because it relates hardware and software.
I will be uploading all of my projects here, some being personal and some being for university.
