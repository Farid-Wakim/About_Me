# About_Me
A little bit about myself.
My name is Farid (Nicolas) Wakim.
I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the Lebanese International University.
I was born on the 16th of October, 1999.
I loved programming and tinkering as a whole ever since I was little, proof being when I started modifying games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas at age 13.
I sometimes tinker on one of my 3 ARDUINO'S (or RASPBERRY PI) because they relate hardware and software, I also disassemble and reassemble lots of other electonics to see how they work.
I will be uploading all of my projects here, some being personal and some being for university.
